# Interpolation-And-Polynomial-Approximation
In this project, we have implemented interpolation and polynomial approximation using Cubic Spline Interpolation method. We have implemented Runge-Kutta methods for initial value problem used for Ordinary Differential Equations as well.

"Cubic Spline":
Cubic spline interpolation is a special case for Spline interpolation that is used very often to avoid the problem of Runge's phenomenon. This method gives an interpolating polynomial that is smoother and has smaller error than some other interpolating polynomials such as Lagrange polynomial and Newton polynomial. A cubic spline is a spline constructed of piecewise third-order polynomials which pass through a  set of m control points. The second derivative of each polynomial is commonly set to zero at the endpoints, since this provides a boundary condition that completes the system of m-2 equations. This produces a so-called "natural" cubic spline and leads to a simple tridiagonal system which can be solved easily to give the coefficients of the polynomials.

"Runge-Kutta":
In numerical analysis, the Runge–Kutta methods are a family of implicit and explicit iterative methods, which include the well-known routine called the Euler Method, used in temporal discretization for the approximate solutions of ordinary differential equations.

"LU factorization":
In numerical analysis and linear algebra, lower–upper (LU) decomposition or factorization factors a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix. LU decomposition can be viewed as the matrix form of Gaussian elimination. Computers usually solve square systems of linear equations using LU decomposition, and it is also a key step when inverting a matrix or computing the determinant of a matrix.
